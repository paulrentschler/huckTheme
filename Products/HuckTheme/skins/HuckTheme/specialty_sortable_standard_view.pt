    Description: used to display people in a certain specialty
                  one person at a time and sorted by lastname,
                  firstname, AND effective date
    Based on: specialty_standard_view.pt (from this product)
    Changes:
      - added the ability to sort the results by effective date
    Notes:
      - the layout is identical to the specialty_standard_view.pt file
        the only change is the ability to sort people by effective date

                  The tal:define statement that is part of the div tag does all the work of
                  sorting the people by their effective date.
                
                  The classification_standard_view and specialty_standard_view have been
                  reworked to support all the reuse necessary to make this work.
