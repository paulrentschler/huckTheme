  Description: used to display collections that contain only people 
                located on the University Park campus. The output
                has been customized to display the information about people
                in a more meaningful way
  Based on: people_topic_view.pt
  Requires: findSpecialtyForTopic.py
  Changes:
    - uses the existing people_topic_view layout
    - defines a limit of only University Park campus people
